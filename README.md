## Introduction

This is a framework for the simulation and design of battery thermal management systems for lithium-ion battery systems.



Further information about the modelling approach and the validation of the model can be found in the following publication:

## Features




## Use and Expansion of the Framework

We are very happy is you choose this framework for your projects and research! We are looking forward to hear your feedback and kindly ask you to share bugfixes, improvements and updates in this repository.

**Please cite the paper above if you use the framework for your publications!**

The model is released under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (29 June 2007). Please refer to the license file for any further questions about incorporating this framework into your projects.

## Requirements

The model was created with **MATLAB 2018b**. If you want to commit an updated version using another toolbox please give us a short heads-up. 

Required Toolboxes:
- Simulink 9.2
- DSP Systems Toolbox 9.7
- Simulink Coder 9.0

The insitute usually follows the 'b' releases of Mathworks, so the framework may get updated to 2019b in the future.
